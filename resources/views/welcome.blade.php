                    <p>Really nothing much to do here. I could explain this place though...</p>
                    <p>Make a list of things to do around here?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reprogram Your brain's <strong>habit pattern</strong> structure.</li>
                        <li>Use a <i>comfortable</i> way of keeping track of Your things.</li>
                        <li>Follow the progress of anything you take up and track.</li>
                    </ul>
                        
                    <p>What all this means, is with the help of Doti you can now more easily shift your daily focus as You want it!</p>
